Program Instructions:

	With the given instructions the given user inputs can be the following:

		load image (imageName, destination)

		save image(imageName, destination)

		exit

		red-component(imageName, destination)

		green-component(imageName, destination)

 		blue-component(imageName, destination)

		value-component(imageName, destination)

		intensity-component(imageName, destination)

		luma-component(imageName, destination)

		brighten(integer, imageName, destination)

		darken(integer, imageName, destination)

		blur(imageName, destination)

		sharpen(imageName, destination)

		greyscale(imageName, destination)

		sepiatone(imageName, destination)

Simple Notes about each command:

The imageName is the given path of the image which has the imageName and the file type
The destination is the name of the image which is loaded and the name you want to save it by - usually the command which is applied.
the integer is given for the lighting commands which take the given integer and brighten or darken by the given value.

Type this script when the program runs:
	load (rec/tiger.jpg) (img)
	red-component (rec/tiger.jpg) (red-tiger)
	blur (rec/tiger.jpg) (tigerBlur)
	sharpen (rec/tiger.jpg) (tigerSharpen)
	sepiatone (rec/tiger.jpg) (tigerSepia)
	save (red-tiger.jpg) (red-tiger)
	save (tigerBlur.jpg) (blur-tiger)
	save (tigerSharpen.jpg) (sharpen-tiger)
	save (tigerSepia.jpg) (sepia-tiger)
	exit


Output of Script:

loads the tiger jpg image it then runs the red-component command on the image, then goes through the other commands which are blur, sharpen
(these apply the given matrix to the image to get the effect) and sepiatone which then does the color transformation by also applying the given matrix.
it then saves each of the images and quits the program with the new images.
