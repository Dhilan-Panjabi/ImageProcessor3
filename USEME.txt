Program Instructions:

    Download the images in the rec folder which has the JAR file.

    Must load an image into the JAR file which originally starts with no loaded images then the following commands below are run in the terminal.


	With the given instructions the given user inputs can be the following:

		load image (imageName, destination)

		save image(imageName, destination)

		exit

		red-component(imageName, destination)

		green-component(imageName, destination)

 		blue-component(imageName, destination)

		value-component(imageName, destination)

		intensity-component(imageName, destination)

		luma-component(imageName, destination)

		brighten(integer, imageName, destination)

		darken(integer, imageName, destination)

		blur(imageName, destination)

		sharpen(imageName, destination)

		greyscale(imageName, destination)

		sepiatone(imageName, destination)

Simple Notes about each command:

The imageName is the given path of the image which has the imageName and the file type
The destination is the name of the image which is loaded and the name you want to save it by - usually the command which is applied.
the integer is given for the lighting commands which take the given integer and brighten or darken by the given value.

Type this script when the program runs:
	load (rec/tiger.jpg) (img)
	red-component (rec/tiger.jpg) (red-tiger)
	blur (rec/tiger.jpg) (tigerBlur)
	sharpen (rec/tiger.jpg) (tigerSharpen)
	sepiatone (rec/tiger.jpg) (tigerSepia)
	save (red-tiger.jpg) (red-tiger)
	save (tigerBlur.jpg) (blur-tiger)
	save (tigerSharpen.jpg) (sharpen-tiger)
	save (tigerSepia.jpg) (sepia-tiger)
	exit


Output of Script:

loads the tiger jpg image it then runs the red-component command on the image, then goes through the other commands which are blur, sharpen
(these apply the given matrix to the image to get the effect) and sepiatone which then does the color transformation by also applying the given matrix.
it then saves each of the images and quits the program with the new images.

To run the JAR file it can be called in the terminal with the following command:
Java -jar homework5.jar -file <Script>.txt which takes in the script and runs the commmands returns
the output and then quits the program.

Moreover text inputs could be done through the terminal by using the following command:
Java -jar homework5.jar -text which runs the program and shows the instructions for the user and then allows them to write the commands which edits the image.

Or the GUI which is shown below:

GUIDocumentation:
- The run commands button which depending on the selected given commands in the drop down menu will run the command on the image
- Save button saves the image to the given path selected by the user and in the format that the user selects
- Load Button loads the image from the given path selected by the user.
- The drop down menu which has the commands which can be applied to the image
- Instructions button which shows the instructions for the user
- Exit Program exits the program and closes the window.
